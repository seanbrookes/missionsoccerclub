      <p>Teams for men and women are affiliated with Mission Soccer Club and are open to players who are no longer playing in a Youth league.  Once a player registers as an Adult, it can be complicated to return to Youth status so players under 18 should be certain of their decision. Teams play within the Metro Womens’ Soccer League, Fraser Valley Men's Soccer League, or BC Old Timer's Soccer League and are responsible for their own uniforms, referee fees, league registration and player registration, as well securing a coach and determining their team line-up. The Club Affiliation Fee includes field lining and booking, as well as the use of equipment.</p>
      <p>The standard season program runs Sep – Feb/Mar (though training may begin in the Summer). A fun Spring/Summer season starts in April.</p>

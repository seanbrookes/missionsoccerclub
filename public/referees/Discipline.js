      <h1>Discipline</h1><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The Alouette District Youth Soccer Association Discipline Committee holds Discipline Hearings as required.&nbsp;
      All players, coaches and managers taking part in 5-District, BCCGSL, or TCYSA are subject to the decisions of the ADYSA Discipline Committee or to the decisions of the BCSA Discipline Committee.<br /><br /></span>
    </p>
      <h3><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The Discipline Process</span></h3>
      <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Any player, coach or manager who has been ejected from a game must attend a discipline hearing.<br /><br /></span>
      </p>
      <h3><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The Automatic One Game</span></h3>
      <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">All red cards carry an automatic one game suspension. This one game is served automatically by sitting out the next League or Cup game (whichever comes first) after the game in which the red card was received. There are no exceptions to this world-wide FIFA procedure.<br /><br />Any
        coach/team official asked to leave the field by the Referee has been "red carded".&nbsp; A Referee does NOT have
        to show a coach/team official a "red card".&nbsp; If asked by the Referee to leave, do so immediately!
        Discipline rule follows as in above paragraph.<br /><br />Yellow cards have automatic game suspension provision.
          Please refer to the examples below. Offenders may have to attend a discipline hearing.<br /><br /></span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The Discipline Hearing</span></h3>
      <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">All red cards require attendance at a discipline hearing.&nbsp; Failure to attend when called to a hearing may result in an indefinite suspension.&nbsp;
        The ADYSA Discipline Committee member will call you as soon as the Referee's report has been received to let you know the date you are to attend discipline. One team official/adult is expected to attend with players.<br /><br />The
          Discipline Committee at the hearing decides which additional penalty, if any, will be imposed on the person
          who was given the red card by the Referee. This group can suspend within guidelines established by the
          Canadian Soccer Association or the BC Soccer Association; their guidelines permit penalties from a warning to
          a lifetime ban.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /></span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Serving Your Discipline</span></h3>
      <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">A suspended player may attend games but must not wear his/her uniform. Suspended team officials must arrange for someone else to fill their position, and inform their league co-ordinator of that person's name and telephone number. The suspended team official may go to the field, but he/she must stay well back from the sideline. He/she must not coach verbally, by cell phone, or by hand signals. The players must be told not to approach him before, during or after the game. In most cases, the best solution is for the suspended person to stay away from games.<br /><br /></span>
